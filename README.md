Introduction
------------
In the process of MATLAB simulation experiment,  MATLAB canâ€™t run parallel in the Windows operation system.
Besides,  the speed of computation has not reached acceptable level.

We rewrites the immune genetic algorithm in LINUX operation system.
The algorithm uses shared memory to achieve communication between different processes,  binds processor to eliminate resource waste of processor scheduling,
and improves the computational performance by Multi-threading technology.
The simulation results show that the improved parallel immune algorithm not only can improve the speed of calculation,
but also can improve the accuracy of calculation.
